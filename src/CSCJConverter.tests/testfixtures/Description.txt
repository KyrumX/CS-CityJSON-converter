The test_shed.json file is our test file.
While syntactically correct the file isn't 100% correct CityJSON 1.1.
One extra vertex has been added, which does not belong to any of our buildings:
    [
      155380,
      287061,
      30234
    ]
This vertex is outside our 'geographicalExtent', which would make it invalid.
This doesn't matter though since this vertex was added to verify it wouldn't be touched by our
functionality, whereas all other vertices (which do belong to our shed) should be.
